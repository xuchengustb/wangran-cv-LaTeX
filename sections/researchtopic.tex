            	\item \textbf{Blockchain-Enabled Swarm Robotics:} Blockchain technology is used to achieve consensus on tasks in distributed systems, as well as audit and traceability throughout the system's operation. 
            	\item \textbf{Blockchain-Enabled Scientific Big-data Management:} A heterogeneous data storage system based on MongoDB and blockchain is being investigated to solve the problem of data storage, computing, and management in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, which could also be applied to scientific big-data management, such as intelligent manufacturing of materials.
